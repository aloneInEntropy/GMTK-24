## Game
### Theme
"Built to Scale"
### Name
Structura
### Plot
You play as CROWN, an android tasked with escaping the lair of an evil mastermind and going back home. You can shoot enemies and kill them to get building blocks. But beware: several sections of the environment have been destroyed. To fix these, you must use the various terminals around levels. In these terminals, you control a single pixel on a grid with your collected building blocks scattered randomly. You must move around, adding blocks to yourself to create a bridge to make it across the gap. Can you make it across all 5 levels and beat the game?
