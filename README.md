## Game
### Theme
"Built to Scale"
### Name
Abstraction
### Plot
You play as CROWN, an android tasked with infiltrating the lair of an evil mastermind and capturing him. You can shoot enemies and collect their parts for health. But beware: move too fast or take too much damage, and you'll overheat. When this happens, you must complete the tasks within your body to fix it from the outside. But beware (again): even this miniature version of you can overheat. You can descend one final layer to your base parts to rebuild yourself once more.
