- BUGS
    - [x] SEVERE
        - [x] Bridges from previous levels mapping to those in future levels
    - [ ] MODERATE
        - [ ] Occasionally, the blocks widths in GEM don't update correctly. This leads some of them to move past the surrounding wall.
    - [ ] LIGHT
        - [ ] Wall jumping only works if the wall is in the centre of the player character, which is annoying
        - [x]  Sprite is updating when climbing and looking away from the wall
