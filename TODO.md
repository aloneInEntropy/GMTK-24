- [ ] CROWN
    - The base platformer. A building with robotic enemies that can detect the player and shoot at them. There are also several obstacles the player must manoeuvre around the building, going from room to room, killing enemies to get more blocks to build bridges with.

                - Instead of each terminal having an internal BridgeStruct, each should point to a specific element in an array/dict of BridgeObjects. A BridgeObject can be a clickable Area2D that contains the guideline area and the BridgeStruct object. This would make free terminals (see below) feasible.

- [ ] GEM
    - A grid-based movement game. The player must move a tile to touch other "sticky" tiles. After a time limit, or when the player decides to return, the end structure will create a bridge in the main level.
    - [ ] Bridge
        - [ ] Constraint
            - Limiting bridge to being within the specified area in CROWN
        - [ ] Origin
            - Should the bridge be centred around the crosshair or the middle of the overall structure?
                - If it's the former, should the bridge gap be filled in?

- BUGS
    - [x] SEVERE
        - [x] Bridges from previous levels mapping to those in future levels
    - [ ] MODERATE
        - [ ] Occasionally, the blocks widths in GEM don't update correctly. This leads some of them to move past the surrounding wall.
            - FIX: todo
        - [ ] New blocks don't appear when revisiting a submitted bridge 
    - [ ] LIGHT
        - [ ] Wall jumping only works if the wall is in the centre of the player character, which is annoying
            - FIX: see Player/Movement/Wall Climbing
        - [x]  Sprite is updating when climbing and looking away from the wall
